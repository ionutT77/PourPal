PourPal - Specification Draft

Team of 2 - Specification Draft
Team Members: Toma Ionut-Adrian, Shehab Abedalrahman

General Description:
This web application aims to solve the problem of making platonic friends as an adult (18+). It helps users connect by allowing them to create and join casual, group-based social events (called "Hangouts") at local venues like bars, pubs, and coffee shops.

Registration (for User):
A new user needs to register for a single "User" account. Registration requires an unique email address, a password, their first name, and a mandatory confirmation that they are 18 years of age or older.

Logged-in User: Profile & Hangout Creation:
A logged-in user can manage their basic profile. A profile should contain their first name,profile picture, and a short bio (e.g., "My Vibe").

A logged-in user can create a new "Hangout." A Hangout must contain a Title, a Venue/Location (e.g., via a location search API), a Date & Time, a maximum Group Size (e.g., 2-5 people), and a brief description. The user who creates the Hangout is automatically added as the first participant. Also we might have a separate place where you can find listed different bars in the area, from which you can get discounts or offers by showing them that you came through this web app.

Logged-in User: Browsing & Joining Hangouts:
A logged-in user can see a list of all upcoming Hangouts. This list should be filterable by criteria like "Soonest" and "Nearest."

A logged-in user can click on any Hangout to see its full details, including the description and the profiles of users who have already joined.

From the details page, a user can join a Hangout (if it is not full) by clicking "Count Me In!". A user can also leave a Hangout they previously joined.

Once a user joins a Hangout, they gain access to a temporary, group-only chat for that specific event. This is for coordination (e.g., "See you at 7!", "I'm running 5 mins late").

A logged-in user can also see a list of "My Hangouts" (events they have joined or created), separated into "Upcoming" and "Past."

Also you can have the option to add someone as your connection/friend .

After the Hangout ,you can give everyone a comment on their profile.

There is probably going to be a report button (for shady accounts).

There will be a Policy Privacy.

Also since is an 18+ web app, we will have an age verification system(probably not 100% implemented , just the functionality).

These are the main ideas of PourPal functionalities. Might add more in the process. :)


Technical Approach:
Frontend (React.js):
The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React.js. It will be responsible for all UI rendering and user-facing state management.
- React Router will be used for navigation (e.g., /login, /hangouts, /hangouts/123).
- The `axios` library (or native `fetch`) will be used to make API calls to the Django backend.
- All user-facing components (forms, lists, chat windows, profile pages) will be built in React.
- Node.js will be used as the development environment for managing packages (npm) and running the local development server.

Backend (Django):
The backend will be a Python-based REST API built using the Django REST Framework (DRF). It will be responsible for all business logic, user authentication, and database operations.
- Django will handle user registration and authentication (likely using httpOnly cookies for secure session management).
- It will provide all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for Hangouts, User Profiles, and Chat Messages.
- The real-time chat functionality will be implemented (e.g., using Django Channels).
- The built-in Django Admin panel will be used by the team for moderation (handling reports, banning users).
- The database will be PostgreSQL, as it integrates seamlessly with Django.
